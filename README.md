Prize Time Random Picker Used for live draws

All valid tickets will be put into the tickets array. A valid ticket is one that had the correct answer as all competitions are skill based. If you don't see your ticket it's likely you got the answer wrong, please speak to prizetime reps to confirm.

It uses random JS to select a random number between 0 and ticket array length-1.

This random number is then used to select the winning ticket from the array

The winning ticket is then shown on the screen
